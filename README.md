PROTOTYPE

The data:

- The data is randomly generated.

This app provides a platform for testing and comparing pricing policies for products with smaller price points, where extensive promotional campaigns might not be cost-effective. By configuring demand curves based on real-world or hypothetical scenarios, users can evaluate the performance of four pricing policies—Thompson Sampling, Epsilon-Greedy, Online Learning, and Uniform Pricing—against the Oracle (an unattainable ideal policy). It generates insights through regret analysis and cumulative revenue comparisons over multiple simulations. Users can also upload their own demand data or compare policies across a range of products, enabling high-level statistical summaries.
